            <h1>A History</h1>
            <p>David Papa began music in 2006 in middle school and took on several instruments and styles ever since. Music brought David through the thicks and thins of life and brought him closer to many different people because of it. He currently has one tester album out on iTunes, <i>Forks for Breakfast</i>, released in 2012, and an upcoming album called <i>West Valley Bars</i>. This album will test out David's presence in hip-hop and give an insight on the struggles of his stories of life and love.</p>

          <h2>Recorder</h2>
          <div class="description">

          <p>The first instrument David ever played. The classic forced middle school musical staple brings the basics of music theory into a clear and easy way to understand.</p>

          <h2>Buffet R13 Bb Clarinet</h2>
          <div class="description">

          <p>David's clarinet was a professional level horn that promoted not only an aesthetic quality of play, but a buttery sound as well. Played all through high school and some of middle school, the clarinet was his instrument of choice to guide him through the initial trials of music theory, ear training, and basic to advanced rudiments.  </p>

          <h2>Fender CD-60S All-Mahogany</h2>
          <div class="description">

          <p>One of David's first guitars, the All-Mahogany Acoustic Fender Dreadnought presented a natural look and a full sound from the crisp highs to the beefy lows. This guitar was made to suit and accompany baritone voices like David's relatively easily. It also comes with Fender's pick-up system. David performs often with this guitar, especially with songs that require a lot of strumming.  </p>

          <h2>Martin GPCPA4</h2>
          <div class="description">

          <p>The best of both worlds guitar. This grand auditorium acoustic-electric guitar is David's go-to performance/recording instrument. Being one of David's most prized possessions as well, this Martin works equally great with strumming and fingering and compliments most any style of singing. It is the all-around acoustic guitar.</p>

          <h2>Cort Stratocaster (Custom)</h2>
          <div class="description">

          <p>David's custom stratocaster. Silver and black marble painted finish with a marble pick guard, along with everything else basic Cort stratocasters have to offer. David chose these colors in particular in inspiration of John Mayer's stratocaster, which is plain black and is chipped and scratched in many places.</p>

          <h2>Rode NT2A</h2>
          <div class="description">

          <p>David's main recording microphone is a multiband condensor mic by Rode. Surpassing it's successor, the Rode NT1A, this microphone enables users to experiment with its 3-channel filters and omni- and uni- directional settings.</p>
